                    <p id="ParaOne">Hello, I'm Jim Holmberg, a double grad of University of Kansas with degrees in 
                    finance (minor in econ) and law.  I worked as an analyst for the Kansas City Federal 
                    Reserve Bank for two years before returning for law school.
                </p>
                <p>After law school, I took a position with Edward J. Bellen and Partners, a law firm in Frankfurt
                    am Main, West Germany specializing in military law, to wit, courts-martial and administrative
                    separation proceedings.  I lived there for three years and gained passable German language skills.
                </p>
                <p>Upon returning to the United States, I focused my practice on bankruptcy law and general civil
                    litigation, even arguing before the Kansas Supreme Court.
                </p>
